# Project Portfolio 3 - Python

## One-Armed Bandit!

> known also as slot machine (American English), fruit machine (British English) or poker machine (Australian English and New Zealand English and is a gambling game that creates a game of chance for its customers [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Armed_Bandit) 

It is a Python terminal game, deployed on Heroku using Code Institute's mock terminal to run.
This project has been designed for educational purposes 

Users are welcomed by the main menu where they enter their name and city before being brought to the main menu where they can choose option 1 to start the game or option 2 to view instructions (Q to Quit). 

After choosing to start the game they type in their name and city.
Users are given the option to start with a default balance of â‚¬100 or change it to the pre-defined amount or set it manually hence changing difficulty level.

Next, users are asked to choose the number of lines they wish to bet on (1-3). The more lines the bigger chance of winning, however, the user bet is then multiplied by the number of lines the user wishes to bet on and deducted from the total balance. Once, users choose the number of lines to bet on, this information is confirmed and printed back to the screen. 

Users then are asked to type in how much would they like to bet per line - this information is also confirmed and printed back to users unless the balance is insufficient to cover the bet. in this instance, users are asked to repeat and choose the number of lines to bet on and confirm bet per line.

Once lines and bet are confirmed, users are presented with the information of their bet total, results of the round and lines and amount they won/lost on. 

The total balance is then adjusted and, if allowed to play, users are asked to play another round. 
If a user loses the whole balance, the game is over and users are brought back to the main menu.

## __Project Goals__

The project goal was to create a user-friendly game and deliver an easy and satisfying command line interface directory.

The project has been built using Python.

## __Brief__

I wish to demonstrate my competency as a Software Developer and showcase Python skills and abilities to potential Employers / Recruiters and all who want to cooperate with me on future projects.

## __UX User Experience__
### __User Stories__

__As a Player, I wish:__

### __Flowchart__

The below flowchart has been created before my code to give me a clear view of what needed to be implemented. It indicates the layout and structure of the program including where the user needs to be asked for input, where the computer validates the input and how to handle invalid inputs, and where the program should subtract and add to the user's balance.

![Flowchart](/assets/images/flow-chart.png)

### __Color Scheme__

To provide a better user experience, I have decided to use a color scheme.
The colours used were from ANSI gamma, as described below:

- Yellow color (\033[1;33;40m)
- Red color (\033[1;31;40m)
- Magenta color (\033[1;35;40m)
- Green color (\033[1;32;40m)
- Blue color (\033[1;34;40m)

### __Class Object__
OOC (Object Oriented Class) has been added in this project to create a Player class.
I used [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) to create it.

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, place, rounds, balance, wins, win):
        self.name = name
        self.place = place
        self.rounds = rounds
        self.balance = DEPOSIT
        self.wins = wins
        self.win = win
```

### __Browser Compatibility__

After publishing to Heroku, the site was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Mozilla Firefox, with no visible issues for the user. 
The site has loaded perfectly and had no issues across all browsers.

[Back to Content](<#contents>)

***

## __Deployment__
### __Deploy to Heroku__

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select *New* in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select *Create new app* from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select *Create App*.
- From the new app *Settings*, click *Reveal Config Vars*, and set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select *Add Buildpack*.
- The order of the buildpacks is important, select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The Procfile can be created with the following command: `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository to the newly created app:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a <app_name>` (replace app_name with your app, without the angle-brackets)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type: `git push heroku main`

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku.

***

# Project Portfolio 3 - Python

## One-Armed Bandit!

> known also as slot machine (American English), fruit machine (British English) or poker machine (Australian English and New Zealand English and is a gambling game that creates a game of chance for its customers [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Armed_Bandit) 

It is a Python terminal game, deployed on Heroku using Code Institute's mock terminal to run.
This project has been designed for educational purposes 

Users are welcomed by the main menu where they enter name and city before being brought to the main menu where they can choose option 1 to start the game or option 2 to view instructions (Q to Quit). 

After choosing to start the game they are type in their name and city .
Users are given the option to start with a default balance of â‚¬100 or change it to pre-defined amount or set it manually hence change difficulty level.

Next, users are asked to choose the number of lines they wish to bet on (1-3). The more lines the bigger chance of winning, however, the user bet is then multiplied by the number of lines the user wishes to bet on and deducted from the total balance. Once, users choose the number of lines to bet on, this information is confirmed and printed back to the screen. 

Users then are asked to type in how much would they like to bet per line - this information is also confirmed and printed back to users unless the balance is insufficient to cover the bet. in this instance, users are asked to repeat and choose the number of lines to bet on and confirm bet per line.

Once lines and bet are confirmed, users are presented with the information of their bet total, results of the round and lines and amount they won/lost on. 

The total balance is then adjusted and, if allowed to play, users are asked to play another round. 
If a user loses the whole balance, the game is over and users are brought back to the main menu.

## __Project Goals__

The project goal was to create a user-friendly game and deliver an easy and satisfiying command line interface directory.

The project has been built by using Python.

## __Brief__

I wish to demonstrate my competency as a Software Developer and showcase Python skills and abilities to potential Employers / Recruiters and all who want to cooperate with me on future projects.

## __UX User Experience__
### __User Stories__

__As a Player, I wish:__ 
- to play a simple and fun but still challenging game.
- to be able to see instructions before the start of the game.
- to play a game that navigates easyly.
- to be able to set bet amount.
- to be able to change game difficulty by changing number of lines I bet on.
- to be given feedback if I entered invalid data. 
- to be able to go reset the game.
- to be able to see current balance.
- to be encouraged to replay and increase scores.

### __Flowchart__

The below flowchart has been created prior to my code to give me a clear view of what needed to be implemented. It clearly indicates the layout and structure of the program including where the user needs to be asked for input, where the computer validates the input and how to handle invalid inputs, where the program should subtract and add to the user's balance.

![Flowchart](/assets/images/flow-chart.png)

### __Class Object__
OOC (Object Oriented Class) has been added in this project to create a Player class.
I used [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) to create it.

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, place, rounds, balance):
        self.name = name
        self.place = place
        self.rounds = 0
        self.balance = DEPOSIT
```

## __Deployment__
### __Deploy to Heroku__

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select *New* in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select *Create new app* from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select *Create App*.
- From the new app *Settings*, click *Reveal Config Vars*, and set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select *Add Buildpack*.
- The order of the buildpacks is important, select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The Procfile can be created with the following command: `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository to the newly created app:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a <app_name>` (replace app_name with your app, without the angle-brackets)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type: `git push heroku main`

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku.

## __Acknowledgements__

As always, big thank you to [Harry Dhillon](https://github.com/Harry-Leepz), my mentor who provided me with guide and excellent feedback throughout the project

One-Armed Bandit! was developed for educational purpouses and as part of my Diploma in Software Development with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).
